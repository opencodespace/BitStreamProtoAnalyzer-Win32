This application is designed for the protocol developers who need to analyze
protocol PDUs against a protocol header format for integrity and analysis.

This application takes a byte stream and compares it against a desired protocol
format. The application has to be fed with protocol format (bit/byte sequence and
the value range for the protocol header).
